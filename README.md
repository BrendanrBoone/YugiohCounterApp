Documented my learning process of how I got my React Native Environment working in a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Out3DU4R-71vg8VJUe2MyoLvWDzBn5Rl1r2ZgyA8gmQ/edit?usp=sharing)
The app can still be improved upon so I won't release it yet, but here's the current [version](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TpXe28ntMHYhu457mrDiDV-Cckv9szy7?usp=sharing)
